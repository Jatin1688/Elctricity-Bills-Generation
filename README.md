Electricity Bill Generation Program implemented using Object-Oriented Programming

- Developed a program in C++ to generate electricity bills based on customer's unit consumption.
- Implemented object-oriented programming principles to create a Consumer class, encapsulating consumer details and bill calculation methods.
- A method calculates the bill amount based on different unit consumption slabs, applying appropriate rates for each slab.
- A method formats and displays the bill details, including customer name, units consumed, and total bill amount.
- Utilized user input to prompt for customer name and units consumed, creating an instance of the Customer class, and generating the bill.
- By modifying the bill calculation logic, the program can be adapted to suit the specific requirements of different electricity companies.

Skills Utilized:
- Object-oriented programming
- C++ programming language
- Input/output handling
- Problem-solving and logical thinking
